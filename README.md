 A light-weight Discord Script Injector for own Mods, Themes, etc.
 
## Credits
First of all, this wouldn't have been possible without the amazing [gist](https://gist.github.com/vanyle/edbdd0c28a0150af3b905b99a4c48f00) by vanyle.
The whole concept + a few scripts directly base on their work, so please check them out, if you want to learn more.

# Build it yourself
With Node.js installed, you can just use clone the repo and use `npm install` in the project directory.
To run the Injector, use `node app.js`.
